Ph.D. student in Statistics at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Lancaster University.

Read enough influential blog posts to find them a necessity in the resume of the modern scientist, also I need to practice my written english. Ironically, I've created this uninflunetial blog. In the hopes of garnering those sweet internet points and, most importantly, the critique and advice from a community I've yet lots (and lots) to learn from. 

Bayesian statistics, Nonparametric Bayesian statistics, anything else that might ease inferece on those two.
